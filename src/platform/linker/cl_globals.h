 * Linker and loader for the Composite system: takes a collection of
 * services with their trust relationships explicitly expressed,
 * dynamically generates their stub code to connect them, communicates
 * capability information info with the runtime system, creates the
 * user-level static capability structures, and loads the services
 * into the current address space which will be used as a template for
 * the run-time system for creating each service protection domain
 * (ie. copying the entries in the pgd to new address spaces.  
 *
 * This is trusted code, and any mistakes here compromise the entire
 * system.  Essentially, control flow is restricted/created here.
 *
 * Going by the man pages, I think I might be going to hell for using
 * strtok so much.  Suffice to say, don't multithread this program.
